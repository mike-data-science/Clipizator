"""The virality rubric: T1 prompt/schema, cross-validation multipliers,
platform-weighted composite, and full provenance assembly.

The design principle (decision #3, full transparency): a score is never a
bare number. Every clip carries its subscores, which local detectors fired,
which didn't, and every adjustment applied — because an auditable score is
the product's answer to OpusClip's opaque 0–100 that reviewers catch being
wrong.

Cross-validation (the differentiating step, grounded in StandUp4AI's use of
audience laughter as humor ground truth): LLM judgments are discounted when
no acoustic evidence corroborates them and boosted when independent
detectors agree. The constants are design values pending calibration
against real outcomes (the M6 feedback loop exists to tune them).
